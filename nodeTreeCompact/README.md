# Node Tree Compact

![Node Tree compact image](./docs/nodeTree.png)

## The concept is simple.
- Transform your worksheet dimensional data into a vertical hierarchy

- Use this hierarchy as navigation for your viz.  Optionally show a summarized measure label next to each dimension

- Expand and collapse the hierarchy

- Upon clicking on each level of the hierarchy, filter the worksheet (under the context of the parents)

- Perform a global search throughout the hierarchy
